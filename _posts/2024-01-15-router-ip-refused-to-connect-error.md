## Overview

Connecting to `192.168.1.1` is a common task for router configuration, but encountering a **"Connection Refused"** error can be frustrating. In this guide, we'll explore simple and effective steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue, ensuring smooth access to your router's settings.

## 1. Confirm Your Router IP Address

Before diving into troubleshooting, it's crucial to confirm your router's IP address. Run the following Python code to automatically detect your router's IP address:

> In my case my network IP is `192.168.1.0`, so I'll run this Python code below (change the IP based on yours).
{: .prompt-info }

```python
import socket
import requests

def is_ip_reachable(ip):
    try:
        socket.create_connection((ip, 80), timeout=1)
        return True
    except (socket.timeout, socket.error):
        return False

def is_router_page(ip):
    url = f"http://{ip}/"
    try:
        response = requests.get(url, timeout=1)
        return "html" in response.headers.get('content-type', '').lower()
    except requests.ConnectionError:
        return False

def find_router():
    for i in range(1, 255):
        ip = f"192.168.1.{i}"  # change 192.168.1 to your network address
        if is_ip_reachable(ip) and is_router_page(ip):
            print(f"Router found at {ip}")
            break
        else:
            print(f"Checking {ip}...")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_router()
```
{: file='find_router.py'}

> This code will automatically detect your router's IP address. Replace `192.168.1` with your network address.
{: .prompt-tip }

Once the IP is identified, proceed to the next troubleshooting step.

## 2. Disable VMware Virtual Network Adapter

After an hour of troubleshooting, the issue was resolved by disabling the VMware virtual network adapter that shared the same network IP as the router.

> Only disable the VMware network adapter with the same IP network as your router, not all VMware networks.
{: .prompt-warning }

### Steps to Disable on Windows 11:

1. Press `Win + X` to open the Power User menu
2. Select **"Network Connections"**
3. Locate the **"Advanced Network Settings"** section and expand it
4. Choose **"Disable"** from the context menu
5. Confirm the action if prompted

After disabling the conflicting network adapter, attempt to access your router settings again. If the issue persists, proceed to the next troubleshooting step.

## 3. Disable Firewalls and Antivirus

Firewalls and antivirus software may block access to the router interface. Temporarily disable them to check if they're causing the "Connection Refused" error.

> Remember to re-enable your firewall and antivirus afterward to maintain security.
{: .prompt-danger }

Alternatively, try to access your router's IP through your phone mobile to isolate the issue.

## 4. Clear Browser Cache and Cookies

Cached data in your web browser may interfere with accessing the router's page. Clear the browser cache and cookies before attempting to connect again.

### Quick Steps:
- **Chrome/Edge**: `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
- **Firefox**: `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
- **Safari**: `Cmd + Option + E`

## 5. Disable VPN Connections

If you're using a Virtual Private Network (VPN), disconnect it temporarily. VPNs may redirect traffic, causing connection issues to the local router interface.

## Conclusion

By following these troubleshooting steps, you can resolve the "192.168.1.1 Connection Refused" error efficiently. Remember to consider each step carefully, and if the issue persists, consult your router's documentation or seek assistance from the router manufacturer's support.

A smooth connection to your router's interface ensures efficient management of your network settings.
